# Google Instant
## Overview
Google launched `Google Instant` in 2010, and then dropped in in 2017 for device compatibility reasons.
This Chrome extension brings back `Google Instant`, meaning after installing it, you'll see results on Google while you type the query.

## Download
The extension is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-instant/pgkcggibpkmllknengmmihdoeaifkmmc).
